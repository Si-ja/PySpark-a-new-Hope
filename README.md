# Learning PySpark and Spark

This is a a collection of files that can be followed for those interested in learning spark and pyspark. I try to go through them while learning myself and commenting things that interest me and I feel will be worthwhile to come back to. But this is also structured in such a way to be a natural learning tool for anyone getting into Spark with only a code base.

Pre-requisits:
It is assumed you know something about python (including some knowledge of modules such as numpy, pandas and scikit-learn), have an idea what Spark is and have some theoretical knowledge with Machine Learning, because this is what I am trying to apply it to. Things are being done at the most basic level so progression is relativelly slow, but for complete newcomers this might be a bit too code heavy.
